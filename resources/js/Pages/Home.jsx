                                promoting a variety of simple jump or stream maps, including highly difficult mechanics
                                focused maps designed for top players to push their limits.

                                By promoting more of these genres of maps, we hope to satisfy the cravings of players
                                who feel like they're constantly replaying the same old maps from years ago, as rarely
                                do maps of their preference seem to get promoted.
